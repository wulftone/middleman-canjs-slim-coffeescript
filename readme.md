# middleman-canjs-slim-coffeescript

A basic todos application demonstrating the above technologies.

I decided it'd be nice to separate out parts of the app into components, see the components directories for that.  Another notable difference I included was in `index.slim`; I'm using a helper (defined in `config.rb`) to load all of the component templates from the components directories.
